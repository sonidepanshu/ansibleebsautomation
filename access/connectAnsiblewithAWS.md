We will utilize the AWS CloudFormation template "access/iamusercloudformationtemplate.json" to create an IAM policy that grants a programmatic IAM user permission to list EC2 instances, modify their respective EBS volumes and send SNS alerts to `ansiblealerts@deepanshu.com`. The CloudFormation template will store the credentials of the IAM user in AWS Secrets Manager. After the CloudFormation stack is created, we will extract the user credentials from Secrets Manager and store them securely in Ansible using Vault.

### Step 1:
Open the AWS CloudFormation Console
Click on Create Stack, upload "access/iamusercloudformationtemplate.json", and create the stack as guided here: [+](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-create-stack.html)

### Step 2:
After the stack is created, login to your email account `ansiblealerts@deepanshu.com` and confirm the SNS alert `EBSalerts` subscriptions.

### Step 3:
After the stack is created, open the AWS Secrets Manager Console and retrieve the credentials "iamusermodifyvolume-credentials" â€” this will contain the AccessKeyId and SecretAccessKey.

### Step 4:
On the Ansible control node, install Amazon AWS Collection[+](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/amazon/aws/) and create a Vault file to store the AWS credentials by running the command below:
```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install amazon.aws
ansible-vault create ~/.aws/ansible_aws_credentials.yml
```
The command will prompt you to set a password.
After setting the password, add the credentials and save the file:
```yaml
aws_access_key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
aws_secret_key: xxxxxxxxxx/xxxxxx/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
